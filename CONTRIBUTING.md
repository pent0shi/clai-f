## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to **[pentoshi007](https://github.com/pentoshi007)**.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/clai.git
   cd clai
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/pentoshi007/clai.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Node.js | ≥ 20 |
| npm | ≥ 9 |
| Git | ≥ 2.30 |

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start in development mode |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run type checking without emitting files |
| `npm test` | Run the test suite via Vitest |
| `npm run doctor` | Run built-in diagnostics |

### Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in any required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```

## Making Changes

1. **Keep changes focused.** One pull request should address one concern — a single bug fix, feature, or refactor.
2. **Write tests.** If you add or change behavior, add or update the corresponding tests in `test/`.
3. **Run checks locally** before pushing:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   ```
4. **Update documentation.** If your change affects user-facing behavior, update `README.md` or other relevant docs.

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

### Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, or dependency updates |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

### Examples

```
feat(provider): add support for Anthropic provider
fix(tools): prevent duplicate tool calls on rate-limit retry
docs(readme): add Windows installation instructions
test(compaction): add coverage for context compaction edge cases
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date** with `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. **Push** your branch and open a Pull Request against `pentoshi007/clai:main`.
3. **Fill out the PR template** — describe what changed and why.
4. **Link related issues** (e.g., `Closes #42`).
5. **Ensure all CI checks pass.**
6. **Respond to review feedback** promptly and push follow-up commits.
7. A maintainer will merge the PR once it is approved.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [Bug Report issue template](https://github.com/pentoshi007/clai/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) and include:

- **clai version** (`clai --version`)
- **Node.js version** (`node -v`)
- **Operating system** and version
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs. **actual behavior**
- **Relevant logs** or error output

## Requesting Features

Use the [Feature Request issue template](https://github.com/pentoshi007/clai/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) and describe:

- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternatives you've considered

## Style Guide

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Module system:** ESM (`"type": "module"`)
- **Formatting:** Follow the existing code style in the repository
- **Naming:**
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for types, interfaces, and classes
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- **Imports:** Use explicit file extensions (`.js`) for relative imports in ESM
- **Error handling:** Prefer explicit error handling; avoid swallowing errors silently

## Community
